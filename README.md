 auto login to google meets
 Set Up
 Remove "(format)" from secrets.py and classes.json
 Enter your google meet links in the json for each respected block. If you dont have a certain block you can enter "null".
 Enter your chrome path in the secrets.py file.
 Make sure you are already be logged into the desired account by default in chrome.
 then run the program and vibe out.

 *script doesnt remove you from the meet once class is over, so I suggest leaving mannually rather than just chilling with teach for an entire day
